# Developer notes

## Building

The package uses [`nps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nps) as a layer above npm scripts. See [`package-scripts.js`](../package-scripts.js) for all the build targets. Common targets:

```bash
$ nps b    # or nps build - full build with linting
$ nps b.q  # or nps build.quick - build without linting
$ nps l    # or nps lint - lint js and check flow types
$ nps l.j  # or nps lint.js - lint js only
$ nps f    # or nps flow - check flow types
$ nps f.t  #Â or nps flow.typed - update all third-party types via flow-typed
```
